I work with Blender, Python, C++ with msys2, and I am excited about new AI technology.
Right now, this page is pretty random, as it's only purpose is to learn how to deal with [Jekyyl](https://jekyllrb.com/) on [GiHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

I like the clean and customizable interface of the minima theme. I'm still exploring what one can do with it - it's amazing!

Here is a simple 
## Codebox
with Syntax highlighting for Python:
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    '''
    generate a fibonacci sequence up to n
    '''
    val_a=0
    val_b=1
    for i in range(n):
        val_a, val_b = val_b, val_a + val_b
        yield val_b
```
